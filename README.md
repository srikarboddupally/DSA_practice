### About

This is where we document our journey through algorithmic problem-solving. We push LeetCode solutions, write system design notes, and explain our approaches.

### Contents

- **LeetCode Solutions** — Problems solved by multiple contributors, each bringing unique perspectives and implementations.

- **System Design** — Notes on distributed systems, scalability patterns, and architectural principles.

- **Approaches** — Detailed explanations of problem-solving methodologies and the reasoning behind each solution.
