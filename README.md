## 📖 About

Welcome to **DSA Practice Hub** — a collaborative space where we sharpen our problem-solving skills and master algorithmic thinking. This repository serves as:

- 💡 A collection of **LeetCode solutions** with multiple approaches
- 📚 A knowledge base for **system design patterns**
- 🤝 A platform for **collaborative learning** and code reviews
- 📈 A tracker for our **growth as developers**

> *"The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it."* — Dennis Ritchie
